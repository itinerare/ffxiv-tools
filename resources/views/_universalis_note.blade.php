    Local data may be updated from Universalis every 6 hours at most. Both update (last upload to Universalis) and retrieval (local data last updated) times are shown, as available.<br />
    Updates are queued on viewing data for a world and may take a minute or two to be fetched (provided Universalis is currently healthy).
